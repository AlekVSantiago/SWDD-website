        alt="An image of the underworld 1313 Coruscant"
      />
      <p>
        Far, far away in the core world of Coruscant lies the underground
        District 1313, home to some of the most dangerous and shady characters
        this side of the galaxy. It is also home to a maximum-security prison
        run by a small army of Mandalorians. In this prison, we meet our group
        of heroes: Gio Calari, the Quarren thief; Boz, the mechanical genius
        with an abnormal set of calves for a Dug; and a prison guard battle
        droid with a mysterious aura around him. Gio and Boz meet in their cell,
        and it doesn’t take long for them to decide that they want out and will
        do anything to accomplish their goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        After manipulating a drunk guard and stealing forks from the mess hall,
        they move into negotiating with the other prisoners to join their plan.
        This group of supporters includes a Zabrak named Ellis, a Twi'lek spy
        named Targarus, and Dukain the slicer. The plan is simple: shut down the
        power, grab the weapons, and the battleground will become equal to start
        a mutiny. Ellis is to find the supplies, B-0 navigates and retrieves the
        weapons, Targarus organizes the prisoners, and Dukain signals the mutiny
        by shutting down the power grid. There’s only one problem: the Warden
        found out!
      </p>
      <p>
        The night before, Warden Yarrow makes an announcement to the prisoners,
        with Dukain at gunpoint beside her. She executes him and threatens to do
        the same with the rest of the prison if anything else is planned. But
        it’s already too late. With Dukain gone and B-0 already on his way to
        collect weapons, they’ll be sitting ducks fighting an unwinnable battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the mess hall, they are watched closely, with Warden Yarrow present
        with the rest of the guards. Everyone is waiting until B-0 shows up so
        they can make one final stand with whatever they have left. But then, in
        a stroke of fate, the power goes out throughout the whole prison. DUKAIN
        WAS SUCCESSFUL! B-0 arrives just in time to arm our heroes and make
        their way to the final obstacle in their path.
      </p>
      <p>
        With only one way out, the entire prison storms toward the exit. They
        open a hatch at the very top of the roof, leading to a landing pad with
        four prison carriers and guards posted up, ready for a fight. Without
        hesitation, a battle ensues, with four groups heading towards each of
        the cruisers. Warden Yarrow desperately attempts to take on the main
        team and is nearly successful in destroying B-0. However, with the death
        of Jaina’s brother during the battle, she goes into a rage and launches
        one of the freighters towards the Warden, killing her instantly. With a
        clear path forward, the crew make their way to the freighter with Elegos
        the Bothan librarian and Jaina and launch themselves out of the prison.
        Through the cities and past the atmosphere. A couple days later in the
        ship they recieve an encypted communications message from Cato Nemoidia
        claiming to be from B-0's creator...

      <h2 style="text-align: left">Episode 2: Mines of Nemoidia</h2>
      <img class="leftimage" src="./website images/Cato Nemoidia.jpeg" alt="Cato Nemoidia" />
      <p>
        The crew, now on the run, decide to make their first stop on the Planet
        Cato Nemoidia in a city called (Insert City), where they expect to meet
        Dr. Nenu, the creator of B0. They land upon the mining town and
        immediately make their way to the armory first.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are able to acquire new weapons and armor to replace the prison
        equipment that has been marking them as criminals until now. Before they
        leave however, Boz is taken aback by one of the railguns that is
        displayed on the wall. He asks how much it is. The merchant laughs and
        says that he can have it, so long as he can even hold it. Without
        hesitation, Boz carries the railgun with little effort and the arms
        merchant is dumbstruck by the feat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crew then make their way to the bar of the small town where they
        meet the rest of the village to come up with a plan for rescuing Dr.
        Nenu, who has been stuck in the mines for some time now. The crew, with
        no other choice, must join the miners to get Dr. Nenu. On the way down
        to the mine, they learn the ways of the mining guild from the chief
        named Endo, who lost his son in an accident a couple of years prior due
        to the giant beetle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, when the crew finally get to Dr. Nenu, he is found
        encased within a metallic ball from the giant beetle that has been
        keeping it. Through clever battle, the crew free Dr. Nenu and Endo
        delivers the final blow to the beetle thanks to the magnetic charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once they return back to town, Dr. Nenu expresses great joy that he has
        reunited with B0 again and gifts him a special sword to attach onto his
        arm with special magnoid properties to manipulate enemies containing
        metal. However, this reunion is short-lived when a whole host of battle
        droids infiltrate the town to displace all of its citizens. Dr. Nenu
        reveals that the Nemoidian Government has decided to halt mining and all
        production of the battle droid off world to outsource it onto a new
        planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crew, with the help of Endo, Dr. Nenu, and the rest of the village,
        are able to fight them off and save the town at the cost of Dr. Nenu's
        life. In the aftermath, Dr. Nenu has decided to leave his ship (the
        Ghost) with the crew along with the lab for whatever they might need.
        (The Librarian) also decides to stay behind in order to build his
        library in the hopes of providing another source of income into their
        economy, and with nothing else really to lose, Endo decides he wants to
        go on an adventure with the crew and joins them on wherever they go
        next.

      <img

      <p>
        The crew has recieved a distress call from the water world or Mon Cala
        and has decided to answer it in the hopes to barter their services for
        more credits and it's a good excuse for Gio to visit his home planet again. On landing of the planet they are stunned 
        to find out that the Quarren City of (Insert name here) has been taken over by Mon calamari and the remaining Quarren 
        Survivors find refuge on a deserted island far away from the city itself.
      </p>
    </p>
      The group of refugees that the crew meet believe that they should try their best to rebuild a society on the island as best they can. 
      The reason for the distress call was because there is a second faction of Quarrren with the conviction of retaking their lost land
      back from the Mon Calamari and they've been boiling the entire ocean beneath and kidnapping the other Quarren children to accomplish their goal.
      Without hesitation from Gio and Endo especially, they accept the mission to take out the tyranical Quarren leader and unite the Quarren people.     
    </p>
    <p>
      They make their way through a forest toward the new hastily built Quarren City on the other side of the island and run into two shark people(Insert Species name)
      patroling the island, presumably for more Quarren Children to escape. Due to bad luck a tree falls within the forest and the crew
      is hindered, with B-0 and Gio trapped under it, leaving them to somehow deal with the shark people with no clear way to defend themselves
      completey.

      <h2 style="text-align: left">Episode 4: The Molten Run</h2>
      <img class="leftimage" src="./website images/underworld.jpeg" alt="Utapau" />
      <p>
        Utapau… The homeworld of the industrious Papuans. The System lies in the outer rim of the galaxy and hosts an abundance of animal and plant life. 
        Hyper Wind storms rage throughout the surface of the planet, causing the surface to be near uninhabitable by most domestic races. The real unique beauty of the planet lies in its many naturally formed sinkholes so large, spanning thousands of meters deep, housing entire civilizations and providing access to clean underground sea-water. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The planet is mostly known for its robust export of machinery and weapons. 
        Many engineers from all over the galaxy dream of one day moving to the planet in the hopes of pursuing a lucrative job in the ships and weapons industry. 
        The government, for the most part, does not take sides in conflicts outside of their own. This fence-sitting behavior is the key to their financial 
        success since no customer is discriminated against if they have the credits, which has become a controversy on its own for the republic. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In recent months, the Pyke syndicate has taken more control of the planet over the heads of the republic. 
        They have built up a shadow organization to influence representatives to increase the production of weapons 
        and tanks for a secret buyer. This information has all been given by another distress call from an unknown resident of Pau City. 
        A rebellion has popped up since then that aligns itself against the pykes because of their mistreatment of workers and pollution of not only the underground sea but also the core of the planet, 
        which is said to be in a critical condition. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As the crew are on their way to Utapau, they receive yet another distress call from a child on the planet, 
        informing the crew of recent events. After meeting with the child, they plan to join forces with the engineering union of Utapau, 
        who have been conspiring to take back their city. To do this, they must go undetected through the windy deserts of Utapau and enter 
        the capital, Pau City, where the union awaits to strike. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The sands of the dry desert are dangerous when the wind is blowing. The crew is unprepared for the journey, 
        but they know they can make it if they follow the path. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, as they have an unknown 
        encounter with a pair of marauders riding eccentrically colored varactyles. At the back of the saddles, 
        shield generators are mounted to provide them shelter from the sharp sands. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The intentions of the marauders are unclear. Much whispering and secrecy ensue on both sides as they plan their approach. B0 immediately worsens the situation, provoking them like the shopkeeper back in Mon Cala. But before the first weapon is drawn, Gio challenges them to a game of Sabbacc, wagering most of his funds for their help in a safe passage to the city. No deliberation with the marauders is had. They smile and accept the game, and Gio wins with almost no effort. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The marauders honor their bet and join the crew in the rest of the trek through the desert, with the comfort of the shield generators. 
        At the halfway point of the journey, they come across another band of cloaked figures who, at first glance, look like marauders until B0 
        notices the lightsabers at their hips. They’re Jedi! 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Both of them are completely cloaked in their robes, half for the sandstorm and half for secrecy. 
        Despite looking identical, it’s clear one of them is the teacher. The crew goes on edge. Another standoff, but this time with the government proper. 
        “Give us the woman,” the Master says. Endo pulls Jaina aside. Boz gets his weapon ready. B0 raises his fists. Gio attempts another challenge but is quickly shut down. 
        The Jedi are steadfast in their mission to detain Jaina until a good argument is made that it would be neglectful to ignore the needs of the people of Utapau. 
        Reluctantly, the Jedi agree and trail them the rest of the way to the capital. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The city is within reach, but only one obstacle remains. An encounter that none of them could expect. 
        The ground quakes as the dust storm around them creates a vortex, with them at the center of it. 
        A portion of the sand separates, and out strikes a giant snake, creating a wall with its body in their path. 
        Everyone is taken off guard. Luck is not on their side as most of the crew and their allies struggle to do any damage to the snake, including the Jedi. The battle looks grim. 
        As the snake rushes, Boz is eaten, and B0 is hit so hard that he falls apart. With a final shot, Gio defeats the creature. 
        Boz is cut from the stomach of the snake, and B0 is carried the rest of the way. They finally reach the sinkhole leading to the city. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The marauders separate from the crew, but the Jedi eerily continue to follow them without exchanging words. 
        Pau City is a masterpiece, if it weren’t for it being almost a ghost town in the streets, thanks to the Pyke syndicate.
